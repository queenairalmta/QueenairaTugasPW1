    			My name is Queenaira Novinada L. I'm an Informatics Engineering student at
    			University of Suryakancana.
   				I created this website as part of one of my subjects "Pemrograman Web I".
    			It’s designed to showcase what I’ve learned about HTML, CSS, and web layout structure.
  			</p>

  			<p>
   				If you’d like to know more about me, please visit the Biodata page.
    			You can also explore my coding works and other assignments by visiting
    			Assignment, which links directly to my 
    			GitHub.
  			</p>

			<p>
    			Never be afraid to try new things, that's how we grow, don't let failure be a stumbling block, 
				but make it a stepping stone to go further, stop waiting for perfection, start with what you have now.
  			</p>

    			I really appreciate your feedback which helps me to improve, thank you for your visit 🙏
